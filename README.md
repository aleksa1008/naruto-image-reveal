Phase 1: Setting Up the Screen and Layout
Define the Canvas: I will establish the total game window size where everything will appear.

Create the Game Base: I will create the main game container that takes up 80% of the screen area. All other elements will live inside this container.

Divide the Base Area (Using CSS Grid): Inside the Game Base, I will create two main columns:

The Picture Reveal Area:** I will assign 20% of the base width to this section (e.g., on the left side).

The Gameplay Area:* I will assign 60% of the base width to this section (e.g., on the right side).

 Set up the Pictures:

I will load the Hidden Image and place it in the Picture Reveal Area. I will ensure this image is split into 3 logical sections for the level reveals.

I will load the Cover Image and place it directly on top of the Hidden Image, completely obscuring it.

 Build the Instructions Screen:

I will create a layer that initially covers the entire Game Base.

I will display the game Instructions on this layer, using clear text. This layer will block all game interaction until it is dismissed.

 Place the Controls:
 I will place the Start/Reset Button somewhere easily accessible (perhaps in the remaining 20% of the screen or near the Instructions). Its initial text will be "Start."

Initialize Game Variables:
 I will set the starting Level to 1 and the Missed Ramen Counter to 0.

 Phase 2: Starting the Game and Core Loop
 Start Action:
 When the player clicks the "Start" button:

I will immediately remove the Instructions Layer.

I will change the button text to "Reset."

I will place the Basket object at a starting point at the bottom of the Gameplay Area.

I will initialize the master list of active ramen (an empty list for now).

Handle Player Input: I will continuously listen for the player's control input (e.g., keyboard/mouse) and move the Basket horizontally within the boundaries of the Gameplay Area.

Continuous Ramen Spawning (Falling Loop):

I will start a timed loop to create new Ramen objects at a random horizontal position at the top of the Gameplay Area.

I will control the frequency of this loop: the higher the current Level, the shorter the time interval between spawns (meaning ramen falls more frequently).

I will add each new ramen piece to the master list.

Update All Ramen Positions: In every frame of the game:

I will go through every single Ramen object in the master list.

I will update its vertical position to make it fall downward.

The fall speed will be determined by the current Level (faster for higher levels).

Check for Hits (Collision Detection): For every falling Ramen:

IF the Ramen objectâ€™s position overlaps with the Basket's position (a successful catch):

I will remove that specific Ramen from the master list.

I will increment the current Level's Score.

Check for Misses: For every falling Ramen:

IF the Ramen falls past the bottom boundary of the Gameplay Area:

I will remove that specific Ramen from the master list.

I will increment the Missed Ramen Counter by 1.

I will immediately perform the Game Over Check.

Phase 3: Level Progression and Game End
Game Over Check:

IF the Missed Ramen Counter is greater than 1:

I will immediately stop all ramen spawning and movement.

I will display the Game Over Screen (see step 5 below).

ELSE, the game continues.

Level Complete Check: I will define a target Score needed to complete the current level (e.g., 10 successful catches).

IF the current Score reaches the target:

I will stop all current ramen spawning.

I will trigger the Picture Reveal.

Picture Reveal: I will remove the section of the Cover Image corresponding to the current Level (e.g., for Level 1, I remove section 1).

Game Win Check:

IF the newly completed Level is 3 (meaning all sections are uncovered):

I will display the Game Win Screen (see step 6 below).

ELSE (if Level 1 or 2 was just finished):

I will increment the Level by 1.

I will reset the Score to 0.

I will resume the game loop with the new, faster fall speed.

Display Game Over: I will create a layer that covers the entire Game Base and display the text "GAME OVER." I will also display the Picture of Naruto Crying on this screen.

Display Game Win: I will create a layer that covers the entire Game Base and display the text "YOU WIN" with a Fireworks animation overlay.

Reset Game: When the player clicks the "Reset" button (or the "Start" button, which has now changed to "Reset"):

I will clear any Game Over/Win screens.

I will reset the Missed Ramen Counter to 0.

I will re-apply the full Cover Image to the Picture Reveal Area.

I will change the button text back to "Start."

I will display the initial Instructions Layer again.
